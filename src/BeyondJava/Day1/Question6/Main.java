/*Q6) You are tasked with writing a processOrderStatus
method that takes an OrderStatus enum as input
and returns a descriptive string based on the order status.
Here's the OrderStatus enum: public enum OrderStatus
{ PENDING, PROCESSING, SHIPPED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED, REFUNDED }
Your processOrderStatus method should adhere to the following rules:
 For PENDING orders, return: "Order is awaiting confirmation."
 For PROCESSING orders, return: "Order is being prepared."
 For SHIPPED orders, return: "Order has been dispatched."
 For DELIVERED orders, return: "Order has been successfully delivered."
 For CANCELLED orders, return: "Order has been canceled."
 For REFUNDED orders, return: "Refund has been issued for the order."
 Use a single switch expression to achieve this.
 Enhancements: yield Keyword: If your logic requires more complex
 processing within a case, demonstrate the use of the yield keyword
 to return a value from the switch expression.
